# 🎯 15×15 CSS Challenge — 15 Days, 15 Projects

Welcome to my **CSS Daily Challenge** — a personal commitment to build 15 mini CSS projects in 15 consecutive days.

Each project focuses on a key CSS concept or layout technique. The goal is to strengthen my styling skills and stay consistent while learning JavaScript alongside.

---

## 🧠 Why This Challenge?

- Reinforce CSS fundamentals while working on JS.
- Build a quick visual reference of common UI patterns.
- Practice responsive design, layout, colors, and animations.
- Maintain daily creativity and coding flow.
