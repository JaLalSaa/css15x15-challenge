# 📦 Box Model Playground

A visual and interactive playground that demonstrates the **CSS Box Model** concept using HTML and CSS.  
This project aims to help beginners clearly understand how content, padding, border, and margin interact in the layout of elements.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Custom Properties, Writing Modes)

---

## 🎯 What I Learned

- 📦 The full structure of the **Box Model** (`margin` → `border` → `padding` → `content`).
- 🎨 How to visually represent each layer using CSS properties like `background-color`, `border`, `outline`.
- 💡 How to write **vertical text** using:
  ```css
  writing-mode: vertical-rl;
  transform: rotate(180deg);

This helped me create labels like Left, Right, Top, and Bottom to clarify the sides of the box.

📐 The effect of box-sizing: border-box and how it impacts width/height calculations.

📱 Basics of responsive design using flexbox and relative units (vw, vh).
